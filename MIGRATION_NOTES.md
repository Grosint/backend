# Migration from Motor to PyMongo Async

## Overview

This project has been migrated from Motor to the PyMongo Async driver to ensure long-term support and compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. Dependencies Updated

- **Removed:** `motor>=2.5.0`
- **Added:** `pymongo[async]>=4.6.0`

### 2. Import Changes

All files have been updated to use PyMongo Async imports:

**Before (Motor):**

```python
from motor.motor_asyncio import AsyncIOMotorClient, AsyncIOMotorDatabase
```

**After (PyMongo Async):**

```python
from pymongo import AsyncMongoClient
from pymongo.database import AsyncDatabase
```

### 3. Type Annotations Updated

- `AsyncIOMotorClient` → `AsyncMongoClient`
- `AsyncIOMotorDatabase` → `AsyncDatabase`

### 4. Files Modified

- `app/core/database.py` - Database connection management
- `app/services/user_service.py` - User service layer
- `app/services/search_service.py` - Search service layer
- `app/services/result_service.py` - Result service layer
- `app/services/search_orchestrator.py` - Search orchestration
- `tests/conftest.py` - Test database setup
- `test_setup.py` - Setup verification script

## Benefits of Migration

1. **Long-term Support**: PyMongo Async is the official async driver for MongoDB
2. **Better Performance**: Optimized for async operations
3. **Future-proof**: Motor will be deprecated in 2026
4. **Consistency**: Same driver for sync and async operations

## Compatibility

The migration maintains full API compatibility. All existing code will work without changes as the interface remains the same.

## Testing

All tests have been updated and should pass with the new driver. Run the test suite to verify:

```bash
pytest
```

## Migration Date

- **Completed**: December 2024
- **Motor Deprecation**: May 14, 2026
- **Motor Support End**: May 14, 2027
